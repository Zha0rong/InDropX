# InDropxKallisto
 
## This is a inDrop pipeline which designates to demultiplex, filter and correct barcodes for inDrop V3 data. The output can be directly used in alignment/quantification software such as STARSolo and Kallisto/BUS.

### The rationale behind the development of this pipeline is because the existing pipeline depends on a very specific set of python libraries and softwares, which makes setting up environment extra hard and prevent researchers to improve the results by using new alignment/quantification algorithm.

### There is no pre-requisite such as acquiring one derelicted version of one specific python library or assigning certain amounts of memory in order to run the pipeline. This pipeline is just easy to use: download it, prepare a reference genome using fasta and gtf (If you are not familiar with how to prepare them there are functions that help you to do that), sit back and relax.
